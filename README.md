# Angular-16-Routing-with-Services
Although Angular does not produce physical files that can be stored on a computer, it produces views. Several views can be combined into a layout or application interface. Routing therefore allow users to switch between views, pass values into views and restrict views based on some logic. Routing also supports lazy loading.


After completing this course participants will be able to:
•	Create a boilerplate Angular application
•	Add components to an existing application
•	Create views and display components.
•	Pass parameters (values) to components
•	Generate child routes
•	Restrain certain components from being loaded until needed
•	Use middleware to support lazy loaded components

Angular 17/18 has launched. It is an important milestone for the Angular team. These versions will continue with stand-alone components and Signals. Most of the changes has to do with server-side rendering, hydration, deferrable views, image optimization and animations. There are also some new template directives with control flow. Version focusses mainly on state management and other features that will make Angular applications faster, more powerful, and easier to develop and test. This Bootcamp will continue with 16 for now as it will take some time for companies to catch up.
