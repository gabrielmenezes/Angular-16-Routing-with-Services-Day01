# Angular-16-Routing-with-Services
Although Angular does not produce physical files that can be stored on a computer, it produces views. Several views can be combined into a layout or application interface. Routing therefore allow users to switch between views, pass values into views and restrict views based on some logic. Routing also supports lazy loading.
